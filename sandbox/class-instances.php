/**
 * INSTANCE: a single occurrence of something
 * INSTANCE OOP: a single OBJECT created from a CLASS DEFINITION
 * OBJECT & INSTANCE used interchangably
 * To create an instance we use the 'new': (INSTANTIATE = TO CREATE AN INSTANCE)
 * $person1 = new Person;
 * Usually when we create a new instance of an object we assign it to a var at the same time - thus the var is an instance of the object to be used as needed...
 * $person2 = new Person;
 * Like a while you were out meme pad...
 *
 * get_class($object) - takes an instance as an arg returning the name of the class - pass in instance & get class name
 * is_a($object,$string) - takes in object & string as args & returns true/false if the object has the same class name as the string
 *
